# redux 연습 프로젝트
+ store action reducer dispatch
+ store: 리덕스에서 관리하는 상태를 저장하는 객체이다.
+ action: store의 상태를 변경하기 위한 객체이다.
          action은 type과 payload로 구성되어 있다.
+ reducer: action을 받아서 새로운 state를 만들어주는 함수이다.
+ dispatch: action을 store에 전달하는 함수이다.
           dispatch는 action을 store에 전달하고, store는 reducer를 호출하여 새로운 state를 만든다.

+ useSelector: useSelector Hooks를 이용해서 스토어의 값을 가져올 수 있다.
+ useDispatch: useDispatch Hooks를 이용해서 스토어의 값을 변경할 수 있다.
                store에 있는 dispatch 함수에 접근하는 hook이다.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
